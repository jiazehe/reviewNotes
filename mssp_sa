Enabled by multiple modalities of smart materials-based actuation and sensing, full waveform inversion (FWI) nowadays frequently serves as an advanced ultrasound computed tomography technique that utilizes waveform data to generate high-resolution images of scanned regions. 
This technology offers promise for defect/damage detection and disease diagnosis, showing potential in nondestructive testing, structural health monitoring, and medical imaging. 
To reduce the lengthy computational time caused by time-domain FWI, modern AI-driven and data-driven approaches have been studied to accelerate the reconstruction process in recent years. 
However, most of the existing research has focused on tuning specific neural networks for fixed-domain applications, leaving the relationship between model performance and characteristics of various training datasets underexplored.
This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the improvements achievable with integration of deep learning with the adjoint tomography theory, addressing the scientific questions of how amounts/distributions of the training data, augmentation, and loss functions influences the efficacy of this approach.
The selected integration strategy involves training a U-Net neural network model using pairs of low-resolution inverted images and their corresponding high-resolution ground truth images. 
Once trained, the U-Net model instantaneously converts low-resolution inference images to high-resolution reconstructions. 
Generated using a proposed high-performance computing-based framework, multiple datasets were designed to offer a general representation of various applications while maintaining the shared characteristics across different use cases.
The study also incorporates augmentation strategies to expand the size and complexity of the training dataset without significantly increasing the number of samples.
Furthermore, a hyperparameter tuning framework was introduced to investigate the impact of multiple loss functions on the model performance.
\jhe{2M} An additional challenge in data-driven approaches is the generalizability of the neural network model when exposed to out-of-distribution data.
This study rigorously tests the model's generalizability against several out-of-distribution datasets and finds that the U-Net model maintains a degree of generalizability when trained with unscaled datasets. 

\section{Implementations, Data, and Model}\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Motive of the dataset building}
 
This paper focuses on the improvements achievable with integration of deep learning with the adjoint tomography theory, addressing the scientific questions of how amounts/distributions of the training data, augmentation, and loss functions influences the efficacy of this approach. Prior to the application of this technique to real-world data, it is imperative to establish a fundamental understanding of the concept of combining DL methodology and FWI-USCT, while concurrently setting a benchmark for the approach's efficacy. 
As a pivotal preliminary step, this study concentrates on a water-immersed scanning setup with embedded, unknown material distributions with rectangular, possibly overlapped shapes. The design of the datasets aims to preserve the dominate challenges of nonlinear characteristics of the inverse problems that ultrasonic FWI faces while shows a certain level of relevance to two specific applications: 1) material properties reconstruction in NDT \cite{he2021numerical} to identify with inclusions  or foreign object debris and 2) tissue stiffness reconstruction for medical USCT to evaluate tumors \cite{li20213}, where realistic, complex-shaped targets have been successfully reconstructed using traditional time-domain FWI.  
Because this research focus on building the relationship between the aforementioned characteristics of data/model and the efficacy of the AI-empowered approach, random material disturbance from the background material (i.e., water) was selected to enable the full control of the dataset distribution for probing the inherent FWI-related physics. 
On the other hand, our other ongoing work involves exploring the specific application for medical breast USCT using a much more realistic, clinical extracted dataset with experimental USCT scanning. However, this medical dataset, while more realistic, does not have the traits that this FWI-centralized paper requires, including unlimited control of the amount/distributions and minimized bias in FWI reconstructions caused by application-specific preferences.

==========================================





Reviewer #1: The manuscript describes an FWI implementation on ultrasound data assisted by machine learning. The paper is generally well written and the organization is good. However, I have some major concerns that I hope the authors would address.

I know it is mentioned, but the reader might get confused. What is the Unet trained to do? What are the labels? And what are the inputs to the network? Are the inputs smooth versions of the set of velocity models they built? Why not add to Figure 7 sample images of input and output on the sides. The authors should add clarifications on the matter. Also, where are the training loss plots for training and validation data, as such information provides the reader with insights into the training.

I am missing the context, for example what does the velocity model perturbation represent in practical terms. In other words, Figures like 9, 10, and others correspond to what media example and what experiment. Is this NDT? Are we looking at fractures or cracks? Or medical anomalies?

In out of distribution test, I noticed that the kind of perturbations, though scale different, is similar to the training data. They are mainly centered in the middle and have similar size. What happens if the perturbation is very small, like one small square?

The conclusion is long, mainly because it includes a lot of specifics. Conclusions are often a single long paragraph that summaries main results and findings. No need for numbers as the numbers for many do not mean a lot. What matters is what do these numbers suggest.

I include additional comments and suggestions (including the mentioned ones in more details) in the annotated version of the paper. I encourage the authors to address them and make the necessary revision.



Reviewer #2: This paper uses deep learning approaches to speed up the reconstruction of ultrasound tomography using full waveform inversion.

My first issue is about applicability. The authors fairly generally refer to applications in NDT, SHM and medical imaging and give little detail of specific cases. This is important because machine learning is inherently dependent on the type of data it is reconstructing. It also reflects the value that FWI brings in the first place: within NDT/SHM, there have been no demonstrated examples where FWI velocity mapping gives any benefit over existing methods, but has the big downside of the huge computational resource.

Human tissue behaves in a very different way to NDT/SHM applications with very different maps to be reconstructed and different ultrasound wave physics. There may be more merit in FWI for these applications, but the examples presented through the paper of arbitrary sized orthogonal blocks are in no way representative of this, and not representative of any NDT examples either.

All data is simulated throughout. I couldn't see a specific section on how the data is generated, which would be needed, but also it concerns me that the same model is used both for generating test data and as the forward model in the inversion (i.e. the so-called "inverse crime"). There is nothing to demonstrate that this would work in the real world.

Overall I cannot see significant value in the method for the application areas mentioned, and what is demonstrated in this paper does little to convince me of its merits. Finally I have seen quite a lot of papers talking about ML/AI for accelerating FWI already, so I'm not sure that another paper on the same idea is particularly needed.
